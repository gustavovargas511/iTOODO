#TODOit

TODOit is a simple yet efficient task management application that enables users to sign in, create, read, update, and delete tasks.

It is built using Core PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and Vanilla JS.

The project will be periodically updated with refactoring and code reuse improvements.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own projects!
